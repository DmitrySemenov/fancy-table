# Fancy Table project

Create a "functional" table (like a spread sheet) where rows can be filtered, sorted, and the table paginated.

- User can sort (eg: clicking on the column header)
- User can filter/search (input-field)
- User can determine the number of entries per page
- User can change pages
- User can hide/show columns (think of how to do this in a good way)
- An example JSON file is provided as the data source (src/assets/data/data.json). Just import it into the file or fetch() it from GitHub.

### Code
- Emphasis is placed on functionality and code quality
- Optional: Attractive design

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
